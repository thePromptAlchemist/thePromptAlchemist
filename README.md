- 👋 Hi, I’m @thePromptAlchemist
- 👀 I’m interested in DIY everything, prompt imagineering, dev collab, program synthesis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the things! (ML, AI, LLM, AR/VR, web3, python)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all the things! (music, art, poetry, NLP, AI)
- 📫 How to reach me: ...you don't :) I find you if I'm interested in your work.
- 😄 Pronouns: no thx, but you can call me 'Al'! ;)
- ⚡ Fun fact: the 'Prompt' in my name DOES NOT refer to punctuality, FYI.
-  currently ideating a community publication & networking resource: the Indig Press. Look for a newsletter, discord community, and related apps coming SOON(ish)!
